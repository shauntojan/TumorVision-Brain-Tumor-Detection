# TumorVision Brain Tumor Detection
 Developing a neural network-based system capable of detecting brain tumors • Enhanced dataset using data augmentation and data preprocessing techniques after initial dataset evaluation on Kaggle. • Utilizing transfer learning, pre-trained VGG19 models are fine-tuned and optimized through incremental unfreezing. .
